# ttc-simulation
My take on simulating the Bloor-Danforth TTC line, based on files and descriptions by Elizabeth Patitsas at CSC190 (Computer Algorithms and Data Structures, University of Toronto), freely available at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html

Basic usage:
make sim && ./sim

Once you are done:
make clean_sim

See Wiki for details on usage, specifications and testing...
