# ttc-simulation
My take on implementing the simulation of the Bloor-Danforth TTC line, a fun and interesting project that I found online to improve my C skills, based on files and descriptions by Elizabeth Patitsas for the CSC 190 course (Computer Algorithms and Data Structures) at the University of Toronto.

Project website: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html

Basic usage:
make sim && ./sim

Once you are done:
make clean_sim

See Wiki for details on usage, specifications and testing: https://github.com/ignaciop/ttc-simulation/wiki
